# MyWords
The intention was try to find a way to have dictation (for a long paragraph) done completely hands-free. The app will ask user to say a phrase, and then, voice prompt user with up to 5 choices (with confidence level) of recognized  phrases; after the first one is done, user speaks next sentence.

Voice recognition problems:
1.  Some spoken sentences are hard to recognize, and come out with terrible choices, you may customize your app to look for certain keywords, but only if the keywords are in provided choices. 
2.  User cannot make minor corrections with hands free, even a user manually edits the results, this cannot feed back to Google voice recognition system, so that next time, the same sentence would have the same issue.
3.  It is not working "at all" in a driving car, even though windows closed. Granted that my car is not lexury and there are some background engine noises.
