# MyWords
The app will ask a user to speak a sentence, and then, voice prompt user with up to 5 choices (with confidence level) of recognized text to choose; and then user speaks next sentence, all done in hands free mode.

Voice recognition problems:
1.  some spoken sentences are hard to recognize, and come out with terrible choices, you may customize your app to look for certain keywords, but only if the keywords are in provided choices. User cannot make minor corrections with hands free, even a user manually edits the results, this cannot feed back to voice recognition system, so that next time, the same sentence can be recognized correctly.
2.  it is not working "at all" in a driving car, even though windows closed. Granted that my car is not lexury and there are some background engine noises.
